# Real Time Bluetooth Network - Shape The World
A two-module embedded systems MOOC based on an ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller from the University of Texas at Austin through [**edX**](https://courses.edx.org/).


- **UT.RTBN.12.01x Real Time Bluetooth Netword - Shape The World: [UTAustinX UT.RTBN.12.01x](https://www.edx.org/course/real-time-bluetooth-networks-shape-the-world)** includes Modules 1 to 10. \
  [**Certificate**](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/4feb42d2bcd54e919b51f544a829a8a8) available.


You can find a **[syllabus](syllabus.md)** of this course courses.

Every lab is given as an existant project with a grading system TExaS that remotely permits to evaluate my work (and push the grade on edX MOOC). \
As a consequence, for each lab assignment, I completed an existant project given by the teaching staff with the requirements.

My contributions include:
- gloabal declarations (essentially for ports) and/or declarations in header files. 
- functions defintion if already declared by teachers.
- functions implementation otherwise.

In most of the cases, there are all these alternatives (except with the two first introduction labs).

## Common Files

There are some file types which will appear in every lab assignment.

`***.uvproj` `***.uvgui` `***.uvopt` - uVision files (open `***.uvproj` to get the full project) \
`***.axf` `TExaS.h` `texas.o` - autograder files \
`tm4c123gh6pm.h` - useful address definitions for launchpad \
`startup.s` - assembly startup file
